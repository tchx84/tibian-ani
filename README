Tibian-ani is an online times analyzer for CipSoft's MMORPG game Tibia. It
checks for online players and generates useful statistics. It uses google's
visualization API to watch the results.

Usage by example:
1. Create a crontab task to run check.py
   i,e: */15 * * * * /path/to/check.py Amera # will check Amera game world
2. Make sure you gather enough samples.
3. Generate statistics with report.py
   i,e: ./report.py -w Amera # will show general world activity during weekdays
   i,e: ./report.py -w Amera -d Monday # will show general activity, hourly on mondays
   i,e: ./report.py -w Amera -c "Mad Statistician" # will show player's activity
   i,e: ./report.py -w Amera -g "Crazy Guild" # will show guild's activity
   i,e: ./report.py -w Amera -g "Crazy Guild" -c "Mad Statistician" -d Monday # combo!!

Useful for what?!
* Watch your enemy guild online activity.
* Watch your your enemy character most/less active times.
* Combine information to find out the best moment for ingame combat!

Is this too geek?!
Yes.
